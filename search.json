    "text": "1.2 Transition from Pseudocode to Python Programming\nIn this course, our initial approach to understanding and solving linear algebra problems has been through pseudocode. Pseudocode allows us to focus on the logical steps and algorithms without getting bogged down by the syntax of a specific programming language. This method helps us build a strong foundation in the computational aspects of linear algebra.\nHowever, to fully leverage the power of computational tools and prepare for real-world applications, it is essential to implement these algorithms in a practical programming language. Python is a highly versatile and widely-used language in the fields of data science, artificial intelligence, and engineering. By transitioning from pseudocode to Python, we align with the following course objectives:\n\nPractical Implementation: Python provides numerous libraries and tools, such as NumPy and SciPy, which are specifically designed for numerical computations and linear algebra. Implementing our algorithms in Python allows us to perform complex calculations efficiently and accurately.\nHands-On Experience: Moving to Python programming gives students hands-on experience in coding, debugging, and optimizing algorithms. This practical experience is crucial for developing the skills required in modern computational tasks.\nIndustry Relevance: Python is extensively used in industry for data analysis, machine learning, and scientific research. Familiarity with Python and its libraries ensures that students are well-prepared for internships, research projects, and future careers in these fields.\nIntegration with Other Tools: Python’s compatibility with various tools and platforms allows for seamless integration into larger projects and workflows. This integration is vital for tackling real-world problems that often require multi-disciplinary approaches.\nEnhanced Learning: Implementing algorithms in Python helps reinforce theoretical concepts by providing immediate feedback through code execution and results visualization. This iterative learning process deepens understanding and retention of the material.\n\nBy transitioning to Python programming, we not only achieve our course objectives but also equip students with valuable skills that are directly applicable to their academic and professional pursuits.",

    "text": "1.3 Python Fundamentals\n\n1.3.1 Python Programming Overview\nPython is a high-level, interpreted programming language that was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability and simplicity, making it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced developers. Over the years, Python has undergone significant development and improvement, with major releases adding new features and optimizations. The language’s versatility and ease of use have made it popular in various domains, including web development, data science, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, automation, and more. Python’s extensive standard library and active community contribute to its widespread adoption, making it one of the most popular programming languages in the world today.\n\n\n1.3.2 Variables\nIn Python, variables are used to store data that can be used and manipulated throughout a program. Variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The declaration happens automatically when a value is assigned to a variable.\nBasic Input/Output Functions\nPython provides built-in functions for basic input and output operations. The print() function is used to display output, while the input() function is used to take input from the user.\nOutput with print() function\n\nExample 1\n\n# Printing text\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\n\n# Printing multiple values\nx = 5\ny = 10\nprint(\"The value of x is:\", x, \"and the value of y is:\", y)\n\nExample 2\n\n# Assigning values to variables\na = 10\nb = 20.5\nname = \"Alice\"\n\n# Printing the values\nprint(\"Values Stored in the Variables:\")\nprint(a)\nprint(b)\nprint(name)\nInput with input() Function:\n# Taking input from the user\nname = input(\"Enter usr name: \")\nprint(\"Hello, \" + name + \"!\")\n\n# Taking numerical input\nage = int(input(\"Enter usr age: \"))\nprint(\"us are\", age, \"years old.\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe print() function in Python, defined in the built-in __builtin__ module, is used to display output on the screen, providing a simple way to output text and variable values to the console.\n\n\nCombining Variables and Input/Output\nus can combine variables and input/output functions to create interactive programs.\n\nExample:\n\n# Program to calculate the sum of two numbers\nnum1 = float(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\nnum2 = float(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n\n# Calculate sum\nsum = num1 + num2\n\n# Display the result\nprint(\"The sum of\", num1, \"and\", num2, \"is\", sum)\n\n\n1.3.3 Python Programming Style\n\n1.3.3.1 Indentation\nPython uses indentation to define the blocks of code. Proper indentation is crucial as it affects the program’s flow. Use 4 spaces per indentation level.\nif a &gt; b:\n    print(\"a is greater than b\")\nelse:\n    print(\"b is greater than or equal to a\")\n\n\n1.3.3.2 Comments\nUse comments to explain usr code. Comments begin with the # symbol and extend to the end of the line. Write comments that are clear and concise. See the example:\n# This is a comment\na = 10  # This is an inline comment\n\n\n1.3.3.3 Variable Naming\nUse meaningful variable names to make usr code more understandable. Variable names should be in lowercase with words separated by underscores.\nstudent_name = \"John\"\ntotal_score = 95\n\n\n1.3.3.4 Consistent Style\nFollow the PEP 8 style guide for Python code to maintain consistency and readability. Use blank lines to separate different sections of usr code. See the following example of function definition:\n\ndef calculate_sum(x, y):\n    return x + y\n\nresult = calculate_sum(5, 3)\nprint(result)",

    "section": "1.4 Basic Datatypes in Python",
    "text": "1.4 Basic Datatypes in Python\nIn Python, a datatype is a classification that specifies which type of value a variable can hold. Understanding datatypes is essential as it helps in performing appropriate operations on variables. Python supports various built-in datatypes, which can be categorized into several groups.\n\n1.4.1 Numeric Types\nNumeric types represent data that consists of numbers. Python has three distinct numeric types:\n\nIntegers (int):\n\nWhole numbers, positive or negative, without decimals.\nExample: a = 10, b = -5.\n\nFloating Point Numbers (float):\n\nNumbers that contain a decimal point.\nExample: pi = 3.14, temperature = -7.5.\n\nComplex Numbers (complex):\n\nNumbers with a real and an imaginary part.\nExample: z = 3 + 4j.\n\n\n# Examples of numeric types\na = 10         # Integer\npi = 3.14      # Float\nz = 3 + 4j     # Complex\n\n\n1.4.2 Sequence Types\nSequence types are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Python has several sequence types, including:\n\n1.4.2.1 String Type\nStrings in Python are sequences of characters enclosed in quotes. They are used to handle and manipulate textual data.\nCharacteristics of Strings\n\nOrdered: Characters in a string have a defined order.\nImmutable: Strings cannot be modified after they are created.\nHeterogeneous: Strings can include any combination of letters, numbers, and symbols.\n\nCreating Strings\nStrings can be created using single quotes, double quotes, or triple quotes for multiline strings.\n\nExample:\n\n# Creating strings with different types of quotes\nsingle_quoted = 'Hello, World!'\ndouble_quoted = \"Hello, World!\"\nmultiline_string = \"\"\"This is a\nmultiline string\"\"\"\nAccessing String Characters\nCharacters in a string are accessed using their index, with the first character having an index of 0. Negative indexing can be used to access characters from the end.\n\nExample:\n\n# Accessing characters in a string\nfirst_char = single_quoted[0]  # Output: 'H'\nlast_char = single_quoted[-1]  # Output: '!'\nCommon String Methods\nPython provides various methods for string manipulation:\n\nupper(): Converts all characters to uppercase.\nlower(): Converts all characters to lowercase.\nstrip(): Removes leading and trailing whitespace.\nreplace(old, new): Replaces occurrences of a substring with another substring.\nsplit(separator): Splits the string into a list based on a separator.\n\n\nExample:\n\n# Using string methods\ntext = \"   hello, world!   \"\nuppercase_text = text.upper()       # Result: \"   HELLO, WORLD!   \"\nstripped_text = text.strip()        # Result: \"hello, world!\"\nreplaced_text = text.replace(\"world\", \"Python\")  # Result: \"   hello, Python!   \"\nwords = text.split(\",\")             # Result: ['hello', ' world!   ']\n\n\n1.4.2.2 List Type\nLists are one of the most versatile and commonly used sequence types in Python. They allow for the storage and manipulation of ordered collections of items.\n\nCharacteristics of Lists\n\n\nOrdered: The items in a list have a defined order, which will not change unless explicitly modified.\nMutable: The content of a list can be changed after its creation (i.e., items can be added, removed, or modified).\nDynamic: Lists can grow or shrink in size as items are added or removed.\nHeterogeneous: Items in a list can be of different data types (e.g., integers, strings, floats).\n\nCreating Lists\nLists are created by placing comma-separated values inside square brackets.\n\nExample:\n\n# Creating a list of fruits\nfruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n\n# Creating a mixed list\nmixed_list = [1, \"Hello\", 3.14]\nAccessing List Items\nList items are accessed using their index, with the first item having an index of 0.\n\nExample:\n\n\n# Accessing the first item\nfirst_fruit = fruits[0]  # Output: \"apple\"\n\n# Accessing the last item\nlast_fruit = fruits[-1]  # Output: \"cherry\"\nModifying Lists\nLists can be modified by changing the value of specific items, adding new items, or removing existing items.\n\nExample:\n\n# Changing the value of an item\nfruits[1] = \"blueberry\"  # fruits is now [\"apple\", \"blueberry\", \"cherry\"]\n\n# Adding a new item\nfruits.append(\"orange\")  # fruits is now [\"apple\", \"blueberry\", \"cherry\", \"orange\"]\n\n# Removing an item\nfruits.remove(\"blueberry\")  # fruits is now [\"apple\", \"cherry\", \"orange\"]\nList Methods\nPython provides several built-in methods to work with lists:\n\nappend(item): Adds an item to the end of the list.\ninsert(index, item): Inserts an item at a specified index.\nremove(item): Removes the first occurrence of an item.\npop(index): Removes and returns the item at the specified index.\nsort(): Sorts the list in ascending order.\nreverse(): Reverses the order of the list.\n\n\nExample:\n\n# Using list methods\nnumbers = [5, 2, 9, 1]\n\nnumbers.append(4)     # numbers is now [5, 2, 9, 1, 4]\nnumbers.sort()        # numbers is now [1, 2, 4, 5, 9]\nnumbers.reverse()     # numbers is now [9, 5, 4, 2, 1]\nfirst_number = numbers.pop(0)  # first_number is 9, numbers is now [5, 4, 2, 1]\n\n\n1.4.2.3 Tuple Type\nTuples are a built-in sequence type in Python that is used to store an ordered collection of items. Unlike lists, tuples are immutable, which means their contents cannot be changed after creation.\nCharacteristics of Tuples\n\nOrdered: Tuples maintain the order of items, which is consistent throughout their lifetime.\nImmutable: Once a tuple is created, its contents cannot be modified. This includes adding, removing, or changing items.\nFixed Size: The size of a tuple is fixed; it cannot grow or shrink after creation.\nHeterogeneous: Tuples can contain items of different data types, such as integers, strings, and floats.\n\nCreating Tuples\nTuples are created by placing comma-separated values inside parentheses. Single-element tuples require a trailing comma.\n\nExample:\n\n# Creating a tuple with multiple items\ncoordinates = (10, 20, 30)\n\n# Creating a single-element tuple\nsingle_element_tuple = (5,)\n\n# Creating a tuple with mixed data types\nmixed_tuple = (1, \"Hello\", 3.14)\nAccessing Tuple Items\nTuple items are accessed using their index, with the first item having an index of 0. Negative indexing can be used to access items from the end.\n\nExample:\n\n# Accessing the first item\nx = coordinates[0]  # Output: 10\n\n# Accessing the last item\nz = coordinates[-1]  # Output: 30\nModifying Tuples\nSince tuples are immutable, their contents cannot be modified. However, us can create new tuples by combining or slicing existing ones.\n\nExample:\n\n# Combining tuples\nnew_coordinates = coordinates + (40, 50)  # Result: (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)\n\n# Slicing tuples\nsub_tuple = coordinates[1:3]  # Result: (20, 30)\nTuple Methods\nTuples have a limited set of built-in methods compared to lists:\n\ncount(item): Returns the number of occurrences of the specified item.\nindex(item): Returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified item.\n\n\nExample:\n\n# Using tuple methods\nnumbers = (1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1)\n\n# Counting occurrences of an item\ncount_1 = numbers.count(1)  # Result: 3\n\n# Finding the index of an item\nindex_2 = numbers.index(2)  # Result: 1\n\n\n\n1.4.3 Mapping Types\nMapping types in Python are used to store data in key-value pairs. Unlike sequences, mappings do not maintain an order and are designed for quick lookups of data.\n\n1.4.3.1 Dictionary (dict)\nThe primary mapping type in Python is the dict. Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs, where each key must be unique, and keys are used to access their corresponding values.\nCharacteristics of Dictionaries\n\nUnordered: The order of items is not guaranteed and may vary.\nMutable: us can add, remove, and change items after creation.\nKeys: Must be unique and immutable (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples).\nValues: Can be of any data type and can be duplicated.\n\nCreating Dictionaries\nDictionaries are created using curly braces {} with key-value pairs separated by colons :.\n\nExample:\n\n# Creating a dictionary\nstudent = {\n    \"name\": \"Alice\",\n    \"age\": 21,\n    \"major\": \"Computer Science\"\n}\nAccessing and Modifying Dictionary Items\nItems in a dictionary are accessed using their keys. us can also modify, add, or remove items.\n\nExample:\n\n# Accessing a value\nname = student[\"name\"]  # Output: \"Alice\"\n\n# Modifying a value\nstudent[\"age\"] = 22  # Updates the age to 22\n\n# Adding a new key-value pair\nstudent[\"graduation_year\"] = 2024\n\n# Removing a key-value pair\ndel student[\"major\"]\nDictionary Methods\nPython provides several built-in methods to work with dictionaries:\n\nkeys(): Returns a view object of all keys.\nvalues(): Returns a view object of all values.\nitems(): Returns a view object of all key-value pairs.\nget(key, default): Returns the value for the specified key, or a default value if the key is not found.\npop(key, default): Removes and returns the value for the specified key, or a default value if the key is not found.\n\n\nExample:\n\n# Using dictionary methods\nkeys = student.keys()        # Result: dict_keys(['name', 'age', 'graduation_year'])\nvalues = student.values()    # Result: dict_values(['Alice', 22, 2024])\nitems = student.items()      # Result: dict_items([('name', 'Alice'), ('age', 22), ('graduation_year', 2024)])\nname = student.get(\"name\")  # Result: \"Alice\"\nage = student.pop(\"age\")    # Result: 22\n\n\n\n1.4.4 Set Types\nSets are a built-in data type in Python used to store unique, unordered collections of items. They are particularly useful for operations involving membership tests, set operations, and removing duplicates.\nCharacteristics of Sets\n\nUnordered : The items in a set do not have a specific order and may change.\nMutable : us can add or remove items from a set after its creation.\nUnique : Sets do not allow duplicate items; all items must be unique.\nUnindexed : Sets do not support indexing or slicing.\n\nCreating Sets\nSets are created using curly braces {} with comma-separated values, or using the set() function.\n\nExample:\n\n# Creating a set using curly braces\nfruits = {\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"}\n\n# Creating a set using the set() function\nnumbers = set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\nAccessing and Modifying Set Items\nWhile us cannot access individual items by index, us can check for membership and perform operations like adding or removing items.\n\nExample:\n\n# Checking membership\nhas_apple = \"apple\" in fruits  # Output: True\n\n# Adding an item\nfruits.add(\"orange\")\n\n# Removing an item\nfruits.remove(\"banana\")  # Raises KeyError if item is not present\nSet Operations Sets support various mathematical set operations, such as union, intersection, and difference.\n\nExample:\n\n# Union of two sets\nset1 = {1, 2, 3}\nset2 = {3, 4, 5}\nunion = set1 | set2  # Result: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n\n# Intersection of two sets\nintersection = set1 & set2  # Result: {3}\n\n# Difference between two sets\ndifference = set1 - set2  # Result: {1, 2}\n\n# Symmetric difference (items in either set, but not in both)\nsymmetric_difference = set1 ^ set2  # Result: {1, 2, 4, 5}\nSet Methods\nPython provides several built-in methods for set operations:\n\nadd(item): Adds an item to the set.\nremove(item): Removes an item from the set; raises KeyError if item is not present.\ndiscard(item): Removes an item from the set if present; does not raise an error if item is not found.\npop(): Removes and returns an arbitrary item from the set.\nclear(): Removes all items from the set.\n\n\nExample:\n\n# Using set methods\nset1 = {1, 2, 3}\n\nset1.add(4)        # set1 is now {1, 2, 3, 4}\nset1.remove(2)     # set1 is now {1, 3, 4}\nset1.discard(5)    # No error, set1 remains {1, 3, 4}\nitem = set1.pop()  # Removes and returns an arbitrary item, e.g., 1\nset1.clear()      # set1 is now an empty set {}\n\n1.4.4.1 ## Frozen Sets\nFrozen sets are a built-in data type in Python that are similar to sets but are immutable. Once created, a frozen set cannot be modified, making it suitable for use as a key in dictionaries or as elements of other sets.\nCharacteristics of Frozen Sets\n\nUnordered : The items in a frozen set do not have a specific order and may change.\nImmutable : Unlike regular sets, frozen sets cannot be altered after creation. No items can be added or removed.\nUnique : Like sets, frozen sets do not allow duplicate items; all items must be unique.\nUnindexed : Frozen sets do not support indexing or slicing.\n\nCreating Frozen Sets\nFrozen sets are created using the frozenset() function, which takes an iterable as an argument.\n\nExample:\n\n# Creating a frozen set\nnumbers = frozenset([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n\n# Creating a frozen set from a set\nfruits = frozenset({\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"})\nAccessing and Modifying Frozen Set Items\nFrozen sets do not support modification operations such as adding or removing items. However, us can perform membership tests and other set operations.\n\nExample:\n\n# Checking membership\nhas_apple = \"apple\" in fruits  # Output: True\n\n# Since frozenset is immutable, us cannot use add() or remove() methods\nSet Operations with Frozen Sets\nFrozen sets support various mathematical set operations similar to regular sets, such as union, intersection, and difference. These operations return new frozen sets and do not modify the original ones.\n\nExample:\n\n# Union of two frozen sets\nset1 = frozenset([1, 2, 3])\nset2 = frozenset([3, 4, 5])\nunion = set1 | set2  # Result: frozenset({1, 2, 3, 4, 5})\n\n# Intersection of two frozen sets\nintersection = set1 & set2  # Result: frozenset({3})\n\n# Difference between two frozen sets\ndifference = set1 - set2  # Result: frozenset({1, 2})\n\n# Symmetric difference (items in either set, but not in both)\nsymmetric_difference = set1 ^ set2  # Result: frozenset({1, 2, 4, 5})\nFrozen Set Methods\nFrozen sets have a subset of the methods available to regular sets. The available methods include:\n\ncopy() : Returns a shallow copy of the frozen set.\ndifference(other) : Returns a new frozen set with elements in the original frozen set but not in other.\nintersection(other) : Returns a new frozen set with elements common to both frozen sets.\nunion(other) : Returns a new frozen set with elements from both frozen sets.\nsymmetric_difference(other) : Returns a new frozen set with elements in either frozen set but not in both.\n\n\nExample:\n\n# Using frozen set methods\nset1 = frozenset([1, 2, 3])\nset2 = frozenset([3, 4, 5])\n\n# Getting the difference\ndifference = set1.difference(set2)  # Result: frozenset({1, 2})\n\n# Getting the intersection\nintersection = set1.intersection(set2)  # Result: frozenset({3})\n\n# Getting the union\nunion = set1.union(set2)  # Result: frozenset({1, 2, 3, 4, 5})\n\n# Getting the symmetric difference\nsymmetric_difference = set1.symmetric_difference(set2)  # Result: frozenset({1, 2, 4, 5})",

    "section": "1.5 Control Structures in Python",
    "text": "1.5 Control Structures in Python\nControl structures in Python allow us to control the flow of execution in our programs. They help manage decision-making, looping, and the execution of code blocks based on certain conditions. Python provides several key control structures: if statements, for loops, while loops, and control flow statements like break, continue, and pass.\n\n1.5.1 Conditional Statements\nConditional statements are used to execute code based on certain conditions. The primary conditional statement in Python is the if statement, which can be combined with elif and else to handle multiple conditions.\n\nSyntax:\n\nif condition:\n    # Code block to execute if condition is True\nelif another_condition:\n    # Code block to execute if another_condition is True\nelse:\n    # Code block to execute if none of the above conditions are True\n\nExample: Program to classify a person based on his/her age.\n\nage = 20\n\nif age &lt; 18:\n    print(\"us are a minor.\")\nelif age &lt; 65:\n    print(\"us are an adult.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"us are a senior citizen.\")\n\n\n1.5.2 Looping Statements\nLooping statements are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. Python supports for loops and while loops.\n\n1.5.2.1 For Loop\nThe for loop iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) and executes a block of code for each item in the sequence.\n\nSyntax:\n\nfor item in sequence:\n    # Code block to execute for each item\n\nExample: Program to print names of fruits saved in a list.\n\n# Iterating over a list\nfruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\nfor fruit in fruits:\n    print(fruit)\n\n\n1.5.2.2 While Loop\nThe while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is True.\n\nSyntax:\n\nwhile condition:\n    # Code block to execute while condition is True\n\nExample: Print all counting numbers less than 5.\n\n# Counting from 0 to 4\ncount = 0\nwhile count &lt; 5:\n    print(count)\n    count += 1\n\n\n\n1.5.3 Control Flow Statements\nControl flow statements alter the flow of execution within loops and conditionals.\n\n1.5.3.1 Break Statement\nThe break statement exits the current loop, regardless of the loop’s condition.\n\nExample: Program to exit from the printing of whole numbers less than 10, while trigger 5.\n\nfor i in range(10):\n    if i == 5:\n        break\n    print(i)\n# Output: 0 1 2 3 4\n\n\n1.5.3.2 Continue Statement\nThe continue statement skips the rest of the code inside the current loop iteration and proceeds to the next iteration.\n\nExample: Program to print all the whole numbers in the range 5 except 2.\n\nfor i in range(5):\n    if i == 2:\n        continue\n    print(i) \n# Output: 0 1 3 4\n\n\n1.5.3.3 Pass Statement\nThe pass statement is a placeholder that does nothing and is used when a statement is syntactically required but no action is needed.\n\nExample: Program to print all the whole numbers in the range 5 except 3.\n\nfor i in range(5):\n    if i == 3:\n        pass  # Placeholder for future code\n    else:\n        print(i)\n# Output: 0 1 2 4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautions When Using Control Flow Structures\n\n\n\n\n\nControl flow structures are essential in Python programming for directing the flow of execution. However, improper use of these structures can lead to errors, inefficiencies, and unintended behaviors. Here are some cautions to keep in mind:\nInfinite Loops\n\nIssue: A while loop with a condition that never becomes False can lead to an infinite loop, which will cause the program to hang or become unresponsive.\nCaution: Always ensure that the condition in a while loop will eventually become False, and include logic within the loop to modify the condition.\n\nExample:\n# Infinite loop example\ncount = 0\nwhile count &lt; 5:\n    print(count)\n    # Missing count increment, causing an infinite loop",

    "section": "1.6 Functions in Python Programming",
    "text": "1.6 Functions in Python Programming\nFunctions are a fundamental concept in Python programming that enable code reuse, modularity, and organization. They allow us to encapsulate a block of code that performs a specific task, which can be executed whenever needed. Functions are essential for writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code, making them a cornerstone of effective programming practices.\nWhat is a Function?\nA function is a named block of code designed to perform a specific task. Functions can take inputs, called parameters or arguments, and can return outputs, which are the results of the computation or task performed by the function. By defining functions, we can write code once and reuse it multiple times, which enhances both efficiency and readability.\nDefining a Function\nIn Python, functions are defined using the def keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses containing any parameters, and a colon. The function body, which contains the code to be executed, is indented below the function definition.\n\nSyntax:\n\ndef function_name(parameters):\n    # Code block\n    return result\n\nExample:\n\ndef greet(name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns a greeting message for the given name.\n    \"\"\"\n    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n\n1.6.0.1 Relevance of functions in Programming\n\nCode Reusability : Functions allow us to define a piece of code once and reuse it in multiple places. This reduces redundancy and helps maintain consistency across our codebase.\nModularity : Functions break down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces. Each function can be focused on a specific task, making it easier to understand and maintain the code.\nAbstraction : Functions enable us to abstract away the implementation details. We can use a function without needing to know its internal workings, which simplifies the code we write and enhances readability.\nTesting and Debugging : Functions allow us to test individual components of our code separately. This isolation helps in identifying and fixing bugs more efficiently.\nLibrary Creation : Functions are the building blocks of libraries and modules. By organizing related functions into libraries, we can create reusable components that can be shared and utilized across different projects.\n\n\nExample: Creating a Simple Library\n\nStage 1: Define Functions in a Module\n# my_library.py\n\ndef add(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the sum of two numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    return a + b\n\ndef multiply(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the product of two numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    return a * b\nStage 2: Use the Library in Another Program\n# main.py\n\nimport my_library\n\nresult_sum = my_library.add(5, 3)\nresult_product = my_library.multiply(5, 3)\n\nprint(f\"Sum: {result_sum}\")\nprint(f\"Product: {result_product}\")",

    "text": "1.7 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python\nObject-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses “objects” to design and implement software. It emphasizes the organization of code into classes and objects, allowing for the encapsulation of data and functionality. OOP promotes code reusability, scalability, and maintainability through key principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.\n\n1.7.1 Key Concepts of OOP\n\nClasses and Objects\n\n\nClass: A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects will have. A class can be thought of as a template or prototype for objects.\nObject: An object is an instance of a class. It is a specific realization of the class with actual values for its attributes.\n\n\n1.7.1.1 Example\n# Defining a class\nclass Dog:\n    def __init__(self, name, age):\n        self.name = name  # Attribute\n        self.age = age    # Attribute\n    \n    def bark(self):\n        return \"Woof!\"   # Method\n\n# Creating an object of the class\nmy_dog = Dog(name=\"Buddy\", age=3)\n\n# Accessing attributes and methods\nprint(my_dog.name)  # Output: Buddy\nprint(my_dog.age)   # Output: 3\nprint(my_dog.bark())  # Output: Woof!\n\nEncapsulation\n\nEncapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, or class. It restricts direct access to some of the object’s components and can help protect the internal state of the object from unintended modifications.\n\nExample: Controll the access to member variables using encapsulation.\n\nclass Account:\n    def __init__(self, balance):\n        self.__balance = balance  # Private attribute\n    \n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        if amount &gt; 0:\n            self.__balance += amount\n    \n    def get_balance(self):\n        return self.__balance\n\n# Creating an object of the class\nmy_account = Account(balance=1000)\nmy_account.deposit(500)\n\nprint(my_account.get_balance())  # Output: 1500\n# print(my_account.__balance)  # This will raise an AttributeError\n\nInheritance\n\nInheritance is a mechanism in which a new class (child or derived class) inherits attributes and methods from an existing class (parent or base class). It allows for code reuse and the creation of a hierarchy of classes.\n\nExample: Demonstrating usage of attributes of base class in the derived classes.\n\n# Base class\nclass Animal:\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n    \n    def speak(self):\n        return \"Some sound\"\n\n# Derived class\nclass Dog(Animal):\n    def __init__(self, name, breed):\n        super().__init__(name)  # Calling the constructor of the base class\n        self.breed = breed\n    \n    def speak(self):\n        return \"Woof!\"\n\n# Another derived class\nclass Cat(Animal):\n    def __init__(self, name, color):\n        super().__init__(name)  # Calling the constructor of the base class\n        self.color = color\n    \n    def speak(self):\n        return \"Meow!\"\n\n# Creating objects of the derived classes\ndog = Dog(name=\"Buddy\", breed=\"Golden Retriever\")\ncat = Cat(name=\"Whiskers\", color=\"Gray\")\n\nprint(f\"{dog.name} is a {dog.breed} and says {dog.speak()}\")  # Output: Buddy is a Golden Retriever and says Woof!\nprint(f\"{cat.name} is a {cat.color} cat and says {cat.speak()}\")  # Output: Whiskers is a Gray cat and says Meow!\n\nPolymorphism\n\nPolymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to be used for different data types. In Python, polymorphism is often achieved through method overriding, where a method in a derived class has the same name as a method in the base class but implements different functionality.\n\nExample:\n\nclass Bird:\n    def fly(self):\n        return \"Flies in the sky\"\n\nclass Penguin(Bird):\n    def fly(self):\n        return \"Cannot fly, swims instead\"\n\n# Creating objects of different classes\nbird = Bird()\npenguin = Penguin()\n\nprint(bird.fly())      # Output: Flies in the sky\nprint(penguin.fly())  # Output: Cannot fly, swims instead",

    "section": "1.8 Working with Files in Python",
    "text": "1.8 Working with Files in Python\nFile handling is an essential part of programming that allows us to work with data stored in files. Python provides built-in functions and methods to create, read, write, and manage files efficiently. This section will cover basic file operations, including opening, reading, writing, and closing files.\nOpening a File\nIn Python, we use the open() function to open a file. This function returns a file object, which provides methods and attributes to interact with the file. The open() function requires at least one argument: the path to the file. we can also specify the mode in which the file should be opened.\n\nSyntax:\n\nfile_object = open(file_path, mode)\nWhere,\n\nfile_path : Path to the file (can be a relative or absolute path).\nmode : Specifies the file access mode (e.g., ‘r’ for reading, ‘w’ for writing, ‘a’ for appending).\n\n\nExample:\n\n# Opening a file in read mode\nfile = open('example.txt', 'r')\nReading from a File\nOnce a file is opened, we can read its contents using various methods. Common methods include read(), readline(), and readlines().\n\nread() : Reads the entire file content.\nreadline() : Reads a single line from the file.\nreadlines() : Reads all the lines into a list.\n\n\nExample:\n\n# Reading the entire file\nfile_content = file.read()\nprint(file_content)\n\n# Reading a single line\nfile.seek(0)  # Move cursor to the start of the file\nline = file.readline()\nprint(line)\n\n# Reading all lines\nfile.seek(0)\nlines = file.readlines()\nprint(lines)\nWriting to a File\nTo write data to a file, we need to open the file in write (‘w’) or append (‘a’) mode. When opened in write mode, the file is truncated (i.e., existing content is deleted). When opened in append mode, new data is added to the end of the file.\n\nExample:\n\n# Opening a file in write mode\nfile = open('example.txt', 'w')\n\n# Writing data to the file\nfile.write(\"Hello, World!\\n\")\nfile.write(\"Python file handling example.\")\n\n# Closing the file\nfile.close()\nClosing a File\nIt is important to close a file after performing operations to ensure that all changes are saved and resources are released. We can close a file using the close() method of the file object.\n\nExample:\n\nf_1 = open('example.txt', 'w') # open the file example.txt to f_1\nf_1.close() # close the file with handler 'f_1'\nUsing Context Managers\nContext managers provide a convenient way to handle file operations, automatically managing file opening and closing. We can use the with statement to ensure that a file is properly closed after its block of code is executed.\n\nExample:\n\n# Using context manager to open and write to a file\nwith open('example.txt', 'w') as file:\n    file.write(\"This is written using a context manager.\")",

    "section": "1.9 From Theory to Practice",
    "text": "1.9 From Theory to Practice\nIn this section, we transition from theoretical concepts to practical applications by exploring how fundamental matrix operations can be used in the field of image processing. By leveraging the knowledge gained from understanding matrix addition, subtraction, multiplication, and other operations, we can tackle real-world problems such as image blending, sharpening, filtering, and transformations. This hands-on approach not only reinforces the theoretical principles but also demonstrates their utility in processing and enhancing digital images. Through practical examples and coding exercises, you’ll see how these mathematical operations are essential tools in modern image manipulation and analysis.\n\n1.9.1 Applications of Matrix Operations in Digital Image Processing\nMatrix operations play a pivotal role in digital image processing, enabling a wide range of techniques for manipulating and enhancing images. By leveraging fundamental matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and transformations, we can perform essential tasks like image blending, filtering, edge detection, and geometric transformations. These operations provide the mathematical foundation for various algorithms used in image analysis, compression, and reconstruction. Understanding and applying matrix operations is crucial for developing efficient and effective image processing solutions, making it an indispensable skill in fields like computer vision, graphics, and multimedia applications.\n\n1.9.1.1 Matrix Addition in Image Blending\nMatrix addition is a fundamental operation in image processing, particularly useful in the technique of image blending. Image blending involves combining two images to produce a single image that integrates the features of both original images. This technique is commonly used in applications such as image overlay, transition effects in videos, and creating composite images.\nConcept\nWhen working with grayscale images, each image can be represented as a matrix where each element corresponds to the intensity of a pixel. By adding corresponding elements (pixels) of two matrices (images), we can blend the images together. The resultant matrix represents the blended image, where each pixel is the sum of the corresponding pixels in the original images.\n\nExample:\n\nConsider two 2x2 grayscale images represented as matrices:\nimage1= [[100, 150],[200, 250]]\nimage2=[[50, 100],[100, 150]]\nTo blend these images, we add the corresponding pixel values as:\nblended_image[i][j] = image1[i][j] + image2[i][j]\nEnsure that the resulting pixel values do not exceed the maximum value allowed (255 for 8-bit images).\nPython Implementation of image blending\nBelow is the Python code for blending two images using matrix addition:\n\ndef matrix_addition(image1, image2):\n    rows = len(image1)\n    cols = len(image1[0])\n    blended_image = [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            blended_pixel = image1[i][j] + image2[i][j]\n            blended_image[i][j] = min(blended_pixel, 255)  # Clip to 255\n\n    return blended_image\n\n# Example matrices (images)\nimage1 = [[100, 150], [200, 250]]\nimage2 = [[50, 100], [100, 150]]\n\nblended_image = matrix_addition(image1, image2)\nprint(\"Blended Image:\")\nfor row in blended_image:\n    print(row)\n\nBlended Image:\n[150, 250]\n[255, 255]\n\n\nImage blending is a powerful technique with numerous real-time applications. It is widely used in creating smooth transitions in video editing, overlaying images in augmented reality, and producing composite images in photography and graphic design. By understanding and applying matrix operations, we can develop efficient algorithms that seamlessly integrate multiple images, enhancing the overall visual experience. The practical implementation of matrix addition in image blending underscores the importance of mathematical foundations in achieving sophisticated image processing tasks in real-world applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Blending as Basic Arithmetic with Libraries\n\n\n\nIn upcoming chapters, we will explore how specific libraries for image handling simplify the process of image blending to a basic arithmetic operation—adding two objects. Using these libraries, such as PIL (Python Imaging Library) or OpenCV, allows us to leverage efficient built-in functions that streamline tasks like resizing, matrix operations, and pixel manipulation.\n\n\nLet’s summarize a few more matrix operations and its uses in digital image processing tasks in the following sections.\n\n\n1.9.1.2 Matrix Subtraction in Image Sharpening\nMatrix subtraction is a fundamental operation in image processing, essential for techniques like image sharpening. Image sharpening enhances the clarity and detail of an image by increasing the contrast along edges and boundaries.\nConcept\nIn grayscale images, each pixel value represents the intensity of light at that point. Image sharpening involves subtracting a smoothed version of the image from the original. This process accentuates edges and fine details, making them more prominent.\n\nExample:\n\nConsider a grayscale image represented as a matrix:\noriginal_image [[100, 150, 200],[150, 200, 250],[200, 250, 100]]\nTo sharpen the image, we subtract a blurred version (smoothed image) from the original. This enhances edges and fine details:\nsharpened_image[i][j] = original_image[i][j] - blurred_image[i][j]\nPython Implementation\nBelow is a simplified Python example of image sharpening using matrix subtraction:\n# Original image matrix (grayscale values)\noriginal_image = [\n    [100, 150, 200],\n    [150, 200, 250],\n    [200, 250, 100]\n]\n\n# Function to apply Gaussian blur (for demonstration, simplified as average smoothing)\ndef apply_blur(image):\n    blurred_image = []\n    for i in range(len(image)):\n        row = []\n        for j in range(len(image[0])):\n            neighbors = []\n            for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                    if 0 &lt;= ni &lt; len(image) and 0 &lt;= nj &lt; len(image[0]):\n                        neighbors.append(image[ni][nj])\n            blurred_value = sum(neighbors) // len(neighbors)\n            row.append(blurred_value)\n        blurred_image.append(row)\n    return blurred_image\n\n# Function for matrix subtraction (image sharpening)\ndef image_sharpening(original_image, blurred_image):\n    sharpened_image = []\n    for i in range(len(original_image)):\n        row = []\n        for j in range(len(original_image[0])):\n            sharpened_value = original_image[i][j] - blurred_image[i][j]\n            row.append(sharpened_value)\n        sharpened_image.append(row)\n    return sharpened_image\n\n# Apply blur to simulate smoothed image\nblurred_image = apply_blur(original_image)\n\n# Perform matrix subtraction for image sharpening\nsharpened_image = image_sharpening(original_image, blurred_image)\n\n# Print the sharpened image\nprint(\"Sharpened Image:\")\nfor row in sharpened_image:\n    print(row)\n\n\n1.9.1.3 Matrix Multiplication in Image Filtering (Convolution)\nMatrix multiplication, specifically convolution in the context of image processing, is a fundamental operation used for various tasks such as smoothing, sharpening, edge detection, and more. Convolution involves applying a small matrix, known as a kernel or filter, to an image matrix. This process modifies the pixel values of the image based on the values in the kernel, effectively filtering the image.\nConcept In grayscale images, each pixel value represents the intensity of light at that point. Convolution applies a kernel matrix over the image matrix to compute a weighted sum of neighborhood pixels. This weighted sum determines the new value of each pixel in the resulting filtered image.\n\nExample:\n\nConsider a grayscale image represented as a matrix:\noriginal_image= [[100, 150, 200, 250],\n [150, 200, 250, 300],\n [200, 250, 300, 350],\n [250, 300, 350, 400]]\nTo perform smoothing (averaging) using a simple kernel:\n[[1/9, 1/9, 1/9],\n [1/9, 1/9, 1/9],\n [1/9, 1/9, 1/9]]\nThe kernel is applied over the image using convolution:\nsmoothed_image[i][j] = sum(original_image[ii][jj] * kernel[k][l] for all (ii, jj) in neighborhood around (i, j))\nPython Implementation\nHere’s a simplified Python example demonstrating convolution for image smoothing without external libraries:\n# Original image matrix (grayscale values)\noriginal_image = [\n    [100, 150, 200, 250],\n    [150, 200, 250, 300],\n    [200, 250, 300, 350],\n    [250, 300, 350, 400]\n]\n\n# Define a simple kernel/filter for smoothing (averaging)\nkernel = [\n    [1/9, 1/9, 1/9],\n    [1/9, 1/9, 1/9],\n    [1/9, 1/9, 1/9]\n]\n\n# Function for applying convolution (image filtering)\ndef apply_convolution(image, kernel):\n    height = len(image)\n    width = len(image[0])\n    ksize = len(kernel)\n    kcenter = ksize // 2  # Center of the kernel\n\n    # Initialize result image\n    filtered_image = [[0]*width for _ in range(height)]\n\n    # Perform convolution\n    for i in range(height):\n        for j in range(width):\n            sum = 0.0\n            for k in range(ksize):\n                for l in range(ksize):\n                    ii = i + k - kcenter\n                    jj = j + l - kcenter\n                    if ii &gt;= 0 and ii &lt; height and jj &gt;= 0 and jj &lt; width:\n                        sum += image[ii][jj] * kernel[k][l]\n            filtered_image[i][j] = int(sum)\n    \n    return filtered_image\n\n# Apply convolution to simulate smoothed image (averaging filter)\nsmoothed_image = apply_convolution(original_image, kernel)\n\n# Print the smoothed image\nprint(\"Smoothed Image:\")\nfor row in smoothed_image:\n    print(row)\n\n\n1.9.1.4 Determinant: Image Transformation\nConcept The determinant of a transformation matrix helps understand how transformations like scaling affect an image. A transformation matrix determines how an image is scaled, rotated, or sheared.\n\nExample:\n\nHere, we compute the determinant of a scaling matrix to understand how the scaling affects the image area.\ndef calculate_determinant(matrix):\n    a, b = matrix[0]\n    c, d = matrix[1]\n    return a * d - b * c\n\n# Example transformation matrix (scaling)\ntransformation_matrix = [[2, 0], [0, 2]]\ndeterminant = calculate_determinant(transformation_matrix)\nprint(f\"Determinant of the transformation matrix: {determinant}\")\nThis value indicates how the transformation scales the image area.\n\n\n1.9.1.5 Rank: Image Rank and Data Compression\nConcept The rank of a matrix indicates the number of linearly independent rows or columns. In image compression, matrix rank helps approximate an image with fewer data.\n\nExample:\n\nHere, we compute the rank of a matrix representing an image. A lower rank might indicate that the image can be approximated with fewer data.\ndef matrix_rank(matrix):\n    def is_zero_row(row):\n        return all(value == 0 for value in row)\n\n    def row_echelon_form(matrix):\n        A = [row[:] for row in matrix]\n        m = len(A)\n        n = len(A[0])\n        rank = 0\n        for i in range(min(m, n)):\n            if A[i][i] != 0:\n                for j in range(i + 1, m):\n                    factor = A[j][i] / A[i][i]\n                    for k in range(i, n):\n                        A[j][k] -= factor * A[i][k]\n                rank += 1\n        return rank\n\n    return row_echelon_form(matrix)\n\n# Example matrix (image)\nimage_matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]\nrank = matrix_rank(image_matrix)\nprint(f\"Rank of the image matrix: {rank}\")",

In this session, we will use Pillow to perform image operations such as resizing and blending to demonstrate the practical applications of these matrix operations in digital image processing.\nMatrix operations have significant applications in digital image processing. These operations can manipulate images in various ways, from blending to filtering. Below we will discuss how matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication are used in real-time image processing tasks.\n\nMatrix Addition: Image Blending\n\nMatrix addition can be used to blend two images by adding their pixel values. This process can be straightforward or involve weighted blending.\nExample 1: Simple Image Blending\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport urllib.request\nurllib.request.urlretrieve('http://lenna.org/len_top.jpg',\"input.jpg\")\nimg1 = Image.open(\"input.jpg\") #loading first image\n\nurllib.request.urlretrieve('https://www.keralatourism.org/images/destination/large/thekkekudi_cave_temple_in_pathanamthitta20131205062431_315_1.jpg',\"input2.jpg\")\n\nimg2 = Image.open(\"input2.jpg\")# loading second image\n\n# Resize second image to match the size of the first image\nimg2 = img2.resize(img1.size)\n# Convert images to numpy arrays\narr1 = np.array(img1)\narr2 = np.array(img2)\n\n# Add the images\nblended_arr = arr1 + arr2\n\n# Clip the values to be in the valid range [0, 255]\nblended_arr = np.clip(blended_arr, 0, 255).astype(np.uint8)\n\n# Convert back to image\nblended_img = Image.fromarray(blended_arr)\n\n# Save or display the blended image\n#blended_img.save('blended_image.jpg')\n#blended_img.show()\n#blended_img #display the blended image\n\nThe input and output images are shown below:\n\nimg1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimg2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nblended_img\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2: Weighted Image Blending\n\n\n# Blend with weights\nalpha = 0.7\nblended_arr = alpha * arr1 + (1 - alpha) * arr2\n\n# Clip the values to be in the valid range [0, 255]\nblended_arr = np.clip(blended_arr, 0, 255).astype(np.uint8)\n\n# Convert back to image\nblended_img = Image.fromarray(blended_arr)\n\n# Save or display the weighted blended image\n#blended_img.save('weighted_blended_image.jpg')\n#blended_img.show()\nblended_img\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.10.2.3 Matrix Subtraction: Image Sharpening\nMatrix subtraction can be used to sharpen images by subtracting a blurred version of the image from the original.\n\nExample 1: Sharpening by Subtracting Blurred Image\n\n\nfrom PIL import Image, ImageFilter\n# Convert image to grayscale for simplicity\nimg_gray = img1.convert('L')\narr = np.array(img_gray)\n\n# Apply Gaussian blur\nblurred_img = img_gray.filter(ImageFilter.GaussianBlur(radius=5))\nblurred_arr = np.array(blurred_img)\n\n# Sharpen the image by subtracting blurred image\nsharpened_arr = arr - blurred_arr\n\n# Clip the values to be in the valid range [0, 255]\nsharpened_arr = np.clip(sharpened_arr, 0, 255).astype(np.uint8)\n\n# Convert back to image\nsharpened_img = Image.fromarray(sharpened_arr)\n\n# Save or display the sharpened image\n#sharpened_img.save('sharpened_image.jpg')\n#sharpened_img.show()\nsharpened_img\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.10.2.4 Matrix Multiplication: Image Filtering (Convolution)\nMatrix multiplication is used in image filtering to apply convolution kernels for various effects.\n\nExample 1: Applying a Convolution Filter\n\n\n# Define a simple convolution kernel (e.g., edge detection)\nkernel = np.array([\n    [1, 0, -1],\n    [1, 0, -1],\n    [1, 0, -1]\n])\n\n# Convert the image to grayscale for simplicity\nimg_gray = img1.convert('L')\narr = np.array(img_gray)\n\n# Apply convolution\nfiltered_arr = np.zeros_like(arr)\nfor i in range(1, arr.shape[0] - 1):\n    for j in range(1, arr.shape[1] - 1):\n        region = arr[i-1:i+2, j-1:j+2]\n        filtered_arr[i, j] = np.sum(region * kernel)\n\n# Convert back to image\nfiltered_img = Image.fromarray(np.clip(filtered_arr, 0, 255).astype(np.uint8))\n\n# Save or display the filtered image\n#filtered_img.save('filtered_image.jpg')\n#filtered_img.show()\nfiltered_img\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 2: Applying a Gaussian Blur Filter\n\n\n# Define a Gaussian blur filter\nblurred_img = img1.filter(ImageFilter.GaussianBlur(radius=5))\n\n# Save or display the blurred image\n#blurred_img.save('blurred_image.jpg')\n#blurred_img.show()\nblurred_img\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.10.2.5 Solving Systems of Equations and Applications\nIntroduction\nSolving systems of linear equations is crucial in various image processing tasks, such as image transformation, camera calibration, and object detection. In this section, we will demonstrate how to solve systems of linear equations using Python and explore practical applications in image processing.\n\nExample 1: Solving a System of Equations\n\nConsider the system:\n\\[\\begin{cases}\n2x + 3y& = 13 \\\\\n4x - y &= 7\n\\end{cases}\\]\n\nPython Implementation\n\n\nfrom sympy import Matrix\n# Define the coefficient matrix and constant matrix\nA = Matrix([[2, 3], [4, -1]])\nB = Matrix([13, 7])\n# Solve the system of equations\nsolution = A.solve_least_squares(B)\n# Print the solution\nprint(\"Solution to the System of Equations:\")\nprint(solution)\n\nSolution to the System of Equations:\nMatrix([[17/7], [19/7]])",

This module is designed to bridge the theoretical knowledge from matrix algebra with practical computational applications. You will learn to interpret and utilize matrix operations, solve systems of equations, and analyze the rank of matrices within a variety of real-world contexts.\nA new concept we will introduce is the Rank-Nullity Theorem, which provides a fundamental relationship between the rank of a matrix and the dimensions of its null space. This theorem is crucial for understanding the solution spaces of linear systems and the properties of linear transformations. By applying this theorem, you will be able to gain deeper insights into the structure of solutions and the behavior of matrix transformations.\nThis transition will not only reinforce your understanding of linear algebra but also enhance your ability to apply these concepts effectively in computational settings.

Our goal is to transform theoretical linear algebra into modern computational applications. We will demonstrate these concepts using Python, focusing on practical and industrial applications.\n\n2.2.1 Matrix Addition and Subtraction in Data Analysis\nMatrix addition and subtraction are fundamental operations that help in combining datasets and analyzing differences.\nSimple Example: Combining Quarterly Sales Data\nWe begin with quarterly sales data from different regions and combine them to get the total sales. The sales data is given in Table 2.1. A ar plot of the total sales is shown in Fig 2.1.\n\n\n\nTable 2.1: Quarterly Sales Data\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion\nQ1\nQ2\nQ3\nQ4\n\n\n\n\nA\n2500\n2800\n3100\n2900\n\n\nB\n1500\n1600\n1700\n1800\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Scratch Python Implementation:\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Quarterly sales data\nsales_region_a = np.array([2500, 2800, 3100, 2900])\nsales_region_b = np.array([1500, 1600, 1700, 1800])\n\n# Combine sales data\ntotal_sales = sales_region_a + sales_region_b\n\n# Visualization\nquarters = ['Q1', 'Q2', 'Q3', 'Q4']\nplt.bar(quarters, total_sales, color='skyblue')\nplt.xlabel('Quarter')\nplt.ylabel('Total Sales')\nplt.title('Combined Quarterly Sales Data for Regions A and B')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Computing Total Sales using Numpy aggregation method\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the above Python code, we have performed the aggregation operation with the NumPy method. Same can be done in a more data analysis style using pandas inorder to handle tabular data meaningfully. In this approach, quarterly sales data of each region is stored as DataFrames(like an excel sheet). The we combine these two DataFrames into one. After that create a new row with index ‘Total’ and populate this row with sum of quarterly sales in Region A and Region B. Finally a bar plot is created using this ‘Total’ sales. Advantage of this approach is that we don’t need the matplotlib library to create visualizations!. The EDA using this approach is shown in Fig 2.2.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# DataFrames for quarterly sales data\ndf_a = pd.DataFrame({'Q1': [2500], 'Q2': [2800], 'Q3': [3100], 'Q4': [2900]}, index=['Region A'])\ndf_b = pd.DataFrame({'Q1': [1500], 'Q2': [1600], 'Q3': [1700], 'Q4': [1800]}, index=['Region B'])\n\n# Combine data\ndf_combined = df_a.add(df_b, fill_value=0)\ndf_combined.loc[\"Total\"] = df_combined.sum(axis=0)\n# Visualization\ndf_combined.loc[\"Total\"].plot(kind='bar', color=['green'])\nplt.xlabel('Quarter')\nplt.ylabel('Total Sales')\nplt.title('Combined Quarterly Sales Data for Regions A and B')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Computation of Total Sales using Pandas method\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can extend this in to more advanced examples. Irrespective to the size of the data, for representation and aggregation tasks matrix models are best options and are used in industry as a standard. Let us consider an advanced example to analyse difference in stock prices. For this example we are using a simulated data. The python code for this simulation process is shown in Fig 2.3.\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Simulated observed and predicted stock prices\nobserved_prices = np.random.uniform(100, 200, size=(100, 5))\npredicted_prices = np.random.uniform(95, 210, size=(100, 5))\n\n# Calculate the difference matrix\nprice_differences = observed_prices - predicted_prices\n\n# Visualization\nplt.imshow(price_differences, cmap='coolwarm', aspect='auto')\nplt.colorbar()\nplt.title('Stock Price Differences')\nplt.xlabel('Stock Index')\nplt.ylabel('Day Index')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Demonstration of Stock Price simulated from a Uniform Distribution\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother important matrix operation relevant to data analytics and Machine Learning application is scaling. This is considered as a statistical tool to make various features (attributes) in to same scale so as to avoid unnecessary misleading impact in data analysis and its intepretation. In Machine Learning context, this pre-processing stage is inevitable so as to make the model relevant and usable.\nSimple Example: Normalizing Employee Performance Data\n\n\n\nTable 2.2: Employee Performance Data\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployee\nMetric A\nMetric B\n\n\n\n\nX\n80\n700\n\n\nY\n90\n800\n\n\nZ\n100\n900\n\n\nA\n110\n1000\n\n\nB\n120\n1100\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing simple python code we can simulate the model for min-max scaling. The formula for min-max scaling is: \\[min_max(X)=\\dfrac{X-min(X)}{max(X)-min(X)}\\]\nFor example, while applying the min-max scaling in the first value of Metric A, the scaled value is \\[min_max(80)\\dfrac{80-80}{120-80}=0\\]\nSimilarly\n\\[min_max(100)\\dfrac{100-80}{120-80}=0.5\\]\nWhen we apply this formula to Metric A and Metric B, the scaled output from Table 2.2 will be as follows:\n\n\n\nTable 2.3: Employee Performance Data\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployee\nMetric A\nMetric B\n\n\n\n\nX\n0.00\n0.00\n\n\nY\n0.25\n0.25\n\n\nZ\n0.50\n0.50\n\n\nA\n0.75\n0.75\n\n\nB\n1.00\n1.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is interesting to look into the scaled data! In the orginal table (Table 2.2) it is looked like Metric B is superior. But from the scaled table (Table 2.3), it is clear that both the Metrics are representing same relative information. This will help us to identify the redundency in measure and so skip any one of the Metric before analysis!.\nThe same can be achieved through a matrix operation. The Python implementation of this scaling process is shown in Fig 2.4.\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Employee performance data with varying scales\ndata = np.array([[80, 700], [90, 800], [100, 900], [110, 1000], [120, 1100]])\n\n# Manual scaling\nmin_vals = np.min(data, axis=0)\nmax_vals = np.max(data, axis=0)\nscaled_data = (data - min_vals) / (max_vals - min_vals)\n\n# Visualization\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))\nplt.subplot(1, 2, 1)\nplt.imshow(data, cmap='viridis')\nplt.title('Original Data')\nplt.colorbar()\n\nplt.subplot(1, 2, 2)\nplt.imshow(scaled_data, cmap='viridis')\nplt.title('Scaled Data')\nplt.colorbar()\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Total sales using pandas method\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the first sub plot, it is clear that there is a significant difference in the distributions (Metric A and Metric B values). But the second sub plot shows that both the distributions have same pattern and the values ranges between 0 and 1. In short the visualization is more appealing and self explanatory in this case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe min-max scaling method will confine the feature values (attributes) into the range \\([0,1]\\). So in effect all the features are scaled proportionally to the data spectrum.\n\n\nSimilarly, we can use the standard scaling (transformation to normal distribution) using the transformation \\(\\dfrac{x-\\bar{x}}{\\sigma}\\). Scaling table is given as a practice task to the reader. The python code for this operation is shown in Fig 2.5.\n\n# Standard scaling from scratch\ndef standard_scaling(data):\n    mean = np.mean(data, axis=0)\n    std = np.std(data, axis=0)\n    scaled_data = (data - mean) / std\n    return scaled_data\n\n# Apply standard scaling\nscaled_data_scratch = standard_scaling(data)\n\nprint(\"Standard Scaled Data (from scratch):\\n\", scaled_data_scratch)\n\n# Visualization\nplt.figure(figsize=(6, 5))\nplt.subplot(1, 2, 1)\nplt.imshow(data, cmap='viridis')\nplt.title('Original Data')\nplt.colorbar()\n\nplt.subplot(1, 2, 2)\nplt.imshow(scaled_data_scratch, cmap='viridis')\nplt.title('Scaled Data')\nplt.colorbar()\n\nplt.show()\n\nStandard Scaled Data (from scratch):\n [[-1.41421356 -1.41421356]\n [-0.70710678 -0.70710678]\n [ 0.          0.        ]\n [ 0.70710678  0.70710678]\n [ 1.41421356  1.41421356]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Min-max scaling using basic python\n\n\n\n\n\nTo understand the effect of standard scaling, let us consider Fig 2.6. This plot create the frequency distribution of the data as a histogram along with the density function. From the first sub-plot, it is clear that the distribution has multiple modes (peaks). When we apply the standard scaling, the distribution become un-modal(only one peek). This is demonstrated in the second sub-plot.\n\n# Standard scaling from scratch\nimport seaborn as sns\n# Create plots\nplt.figure(figsize=(6, 5))\n\n# Plot for original data\nplt.subplot(1, 2, 1)\nsns.histplot(data, kde=True, bins=10, palette=\"viridis\")\nplt.title('Original Data Distribution')\nplt.xlabel('Value')\nplt.ylabel('Frequency')\n\n# Plot for standard scaled data\nplt.subplot(1, 2, 2)\nsns.histplot(scaled_data_scratch, kde=True, bins=10, palette=\"viridis\")\nplt.title('Standard Scaled Data Distribution')\nplt.xlabel('Value')\nplt.ylabel('Frequency')\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Impact of standard scaling on the distribution\n\n\n\n\n\nA scatter plot showing the compare the impact of scaling on the given distribution is shown in Fig 2.7.\n\n# Plot original and scaled data\nplt.figure(figsize=(6, 5))\n\n# Original Data\nplt.subplot(1, 3, 1)\nplt.scatter(data[:, 0], data[:, 1], color='blue')\nplt.title('Original Data')\nplt.xlabel('Metric A')\nplt.ylabel('Metric B')\n\n# Standard Scaled Data\nplt.subplot(1, 3, 2)\nplt.scatter(scaled_data_scratch[:, 0], scaled_data_scratch[:, 1], color='green')\nplt.title('Standard Scaled Data')\nplt.xlabel('Metric A (Standard Scaled)')\nplt.ylabel('Metric B (Standard Scaled)')\n\n# Min-Max Scaled Data\nplt.subplot(1, 3, 3)\nplt.scatter(scaled_data[:, 0], scaled_data[:, 1], color='red')\nplt.title('Min-Max Scaled Data')\nplt.xlabel('Metric A (Min-Max Scaled)')\nplt.ylabel('Metric B (Min-Max Scaled)')\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: Comparison of impact of scaling on the distribution\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the Fig 2.7, it is clear that the scaling does not affect the pattern of the data, instead it just scale the distribution proportionally!\nWe can use the scikit-learn library for do the same thing in a very simple handy approach.

In this section, we will expand on this by exploring different types of matrix products that have practical importance in various fields. One such product is the Hadamard product, which is particularly useful in applications ranging from image processing to neural networks and statistical analysis. We will cover the definition, properties, and examples of the Hadamard product, and then delve into practical applications with simulated data.\n\n2.2.2.1 Hadamard Product\nThe Hadamard product (or element-wise product) of two matrices is a binary operation that combines two matrices of the same dimensions to produce another matrix of the same dimensions, where each element is the product of corresponding elements in the original matrices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition (Hadamard Product):\n\n\n\nFor two matrices \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) of the same dimension \\(m \\times n\\), the Hadamard product \\(A \\circ B\\) is defined as:\n\\[(A \\circ B)_{ij} = A_{ij} \\cdot B_{ij}\\]\nwhere \\(\\cdot\\) denotes element-wise multiplication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperties of Hadamard Product\n\n\n\n\nCommutativity: \\[A \\circ B = B \\circ A\\]\nAssociativity: \\[(A \\circ B) \\circ C = A \\circ (B \\circ C)\\]\nDistributivity: \\[A \\circ (B + C) = (A \\circ B) + (A \\circ C)\\]\n\n\n\nSome simple examples to demonstrate the Hadamard product is given below.\nExample 1: Basic Hadamard Product\nGiven matrices:\n\\[A = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 \\\\\n3 & 4\n\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\nB = \\begin{pmatrix}\n5 & 6 \\\\\n7 & 8\n\\end{pmatrix}\\]\nThe Hadamard product \\(A \\circ B\\) is: \\[A \\circ B = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\cdot 5 & 2 \\cdot 6 \\\\\n3 \\cdot 7 & 4 \\cdot 8\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n5 & 12 \\\\\n21 & 32\n\\end{pmatrix}\\]\nExample 2: Hadamard Product with Larger Matrices\nGiven matrices:\n\\[A = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n7 & 8 & 9\n\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\nB = \\begin{pmatrix}\n9 & 8 & 7 \\\\\n6 & 5 & 4 \\\\\n3 & 2 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\\]\nThe Hadamard product \\(A \\circ B\\) is:\n\\[A \\circ B = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\cdot 9 & 2 \\cdot 8 & 3 \\cdot 7 \\\\\n4 \\cdot 6 & 5 \\cdot 5 & 6 \\cdot 4 \\\\\n7 \\cdot 3 & 8 \\cdot 2 & 9 \\cdot 1\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n9 & 16 & 21 \\\\\n24 & 25 & 24 \\\\\n21 & 16 & 9\n\\end{pmatrix}\\]\nIn the following code chunks the computational process of Hadamard product is implemented in Python. Here both the from the scratch and use of external module versions are included.\n1. Compute Hadamard Product from Scratch (without Libraries)\nHere’s how you can compute the Hadamard product manually:\n\n# Define matrices A and B\nA = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]\nB = [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]\n\n# Function to compute Hadamard product\ndef hadamard_product(A, B):\n    # Get the number of rows and columns\n    num_rows = len(A)\n    num_cols = len(A[0])\n    \n    # Initialize the result matrix\n    result = [[0]*num_cols for _ in range(num_rows)]\n    \n    # Compute the Hadamard product\n    for i in range(num_rows):\n        for j in range(num_cols):\n            result[i][j] = A[i][j] * B[i][j]\n    \n    return result\n\n# Compute Hadamard product\nhadamard_product_result = hadamard_product(A, B)\n\n# Display result\nprint(\"Hadamard Product (From Scratch):\")\nfor row in hadamard_product_result:\n    print(row)\n\nHadamard Product (From Scratch):\n[7, 16, 27]\n[40, 55, 72]\n\n\n2. Compute Hadamard Product Using SymPy\nHere’s how to compute the Hadamard product using SymPy:\n\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define matrices A and B\nA = sp.Matrix([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\nB = sp.Matrix([[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]])\n\n# Compute Hadamard product using SymPy\nHadamard_product_sympy = A.multiply_elementwise(B)\n\n# Display result\nprint(\"Hadamard Product (Using SymPy):\")\nprint(Hadamard_product_sympy)\n\nHadamard Product (Using SymPy):\nMatrix([[7, 16, 27], [40, 55, 72]])\n\n\nPractical Applications\nApplication 1: Image Masking\nThe Hadamard product can be used for image masking. Here’s how you can apply a mask to an image and visualize it as shown in Fig 2.9.\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Simulated large image (2D array) using NumPy\nimage = np.random.rand(100, 100)\n\n# Simulated mask (binary matrix) using NumPy\nmask = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(100, 100))\n\n# Compute Hadamard product\nmasked_image = image * mask\n\n# Plot original image and masked image\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 5))\nax[0].imshow(image, cmap='gray')\nax[0].set_title('Original Image')\nax[1].imshow(masked_image, cmap='gray')\nax[1].set_title('Masked Image')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9: Demonstration of Masking in DIP using Hadamard Product\n\n\n\n\n\nApplication 2: Element-wise Scaling in Neural Networks\nThe Hadamard product can be used for dropout1 in neural networks. A simple simulated example is given below.\n\n# Simulated large activations (2D array) using NumPy\nactivations = np.random.rand(100, 100)\n\n# Simulated dropout mask (binary matrix) using NumPy\ndropout_mask = np.random.randint(0, 2, size=(100, 100))\n\n# Apply dropout\ndropped_activations = activations * dropout_mask\n\n# Display results\nprint(\"Original Activations:\")\nprint(activations)\nprint(\"\\nDropout Mask:\")\nprint(dropout_mask)\nprint(\"\\nDropped Activations:\")\nprint(dropped_activations)\n\nOriginal Activations:\n[[0.22997159 0.566567   0.62393762 ... 0.55926448 0.35075384 0.83272353]\n [0.08417326 0.16590482 0.88557629 ... 0.13937374 0.66051563 0.91165041]\n [0.9577843  0.03932388 0.99283802 ... 0.93212702 0.81067419 0.44715559]\n ...\n [0.8827783  0.03194161 0.66111555 ... 0.83783487 0.58293216 0.4717197 ]\n [0.76747705 0.42684331 0.00911029 ... 0.98008552 0.52943494 0.97673404]\n [0.39705599 0.96645383 0.82416876 ... 0.73132516 0.21326704 0.00183565]]\n\nDropout Mask:\n[[1 1 1 ... 0 1 0]\n [0 0 0 ... 0 0 0]\n [0 1 1 ... 0 0 0]\n ...\n [1 1 1 ... 1 0 0]\n [0 0 0 ... 0 1 0]\n [1 1 0 ... 1 0 0]]\n\nDropped Activations:\n[[0.22997159 0.566567   0.62393762 ... 0.         0.35075384 0.        ]\n [0.         0.         0.         ... 0.         0.         0.        ]\n [0.         0.03932388 0.99283802 ... 0.         0.         0.        ]\n ...\n [0.8827783  0.03194161 0.66111555 ... 0.83783487 0.         0.        ]\n [0.         0.         0.         ... 0.         0.52943494 0.        ]\n [0.39705599 0.96645383 0.         ... 0.73132516 0.         0.        ]]\n\n\nApplication 3: Statistical Data Analysis\nIn statistics, the Hadamard product can be applied to scale covariance matrices. Here’s how we can compute the covariance matrix using matrix operations and apply scaling. Following Python code demonstrate this.\n\nimport sympy as sp\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Simulated large dataset (2D array) using NumPy\ndata = np.random.rand(100, 10)\n\n# Compute the mean of each column\nmean = np.mean(data, axis=0)\n\n# Center the data\ncentered_data = data - mean\n\n# Compute the covariance matrix using matrix product operation\ncov_matrix = (centered_data.T @ centered_data) / (centered_data.shape[0] - 1)\ncov_matrix_sympy = sp.Matrix(cov_matrix)\n\n# Simulated scaling factors (2D array) using SymPy Matrix\nscaling_factors = sp.Matrix(np.random.rand(10, 10))\n\n# Compute Hadamard product\nscaled_cov_matrix = cov_matrix_sympy.multiply(scaling_factors)\n\n# Display results\nprint(\"Covariance Matrix:\")\nprint(cov_matrix_sympy)\nprint(\"\\nScaling

matrix is treated as a vector in a high-dimensional space. For two matrices \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) of the same dimension \\(m \\times n\\), the inner product is defined as the sum of the element-wise products of the matrices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition (Inner product)\n\n\n\nFor two matrices \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) of dimension \\(m \\times n\\), the inner product \\(\\langle A, B \\rangle\\) is given by:\n\\[\\langle A, B \\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} A_{ij} \\cdot B_{ij}\\]\nwhere \\(\\cdot\\) denotes element-wise multiplication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProperties\n\n\n\n\nCommutativity: \\[\\langle A, B \\rangle = \\langle B, A \\rangle\\]\nLinearity: \\[\\langle A + C, B \\rangle = \\langle A, B \\rangle + \\langle C, B \\rangle\\]\nPositive Definiteness: \\[\\langle A, A \\rangle \\geq 0\\] with equality if and only if \\(A\\) is a zero matrix.\n\n\n\nSome simple examples showing the mathematical process of calculating the inner product is given bellow.\nExample 1: Basic Inner Product\nGiven matrices:\n\\[A = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 \\\\\n3 & 4\n\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\nB = \\begin{pmatrix}\n5 & 6 \\\\\n7 & 8\n\\end{pmatrix}\\]\nThe inner product \\(\\langle A, B \\rangle\\) is:\n\\[\\langle A, B \\rangle = 1 \\cdot 5 + 2 \\cdot 6 + 3 \\cdot 7 + 4 \\cdot 8 = 5 + 12 + 21 + 32 = 70\\]\nExample 2: Inner Product with Larger Matrices\nGiven matrices:\n\\[A = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n7 & 8 & 9\n\\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\nB = \\begin{pmatrix}\n9 & 8 & 7 \\\\\n6 & 5 & 4 \\\\\n3 & 2 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\\]\nThe inner product \\(\\langle A, B \\rangle\\) is calculated as: \\[\\begin{align*}\n\\langle A, B \\rangle &= 1 \\cdot 9 + 2 \\cdot 8 + 3 \\cdot 7 + 4 \\cdot 6 + 5 \\cdot 5 + 6 \\cdot 4 + 7 \\cdot 3 + 8 \\cdot 2 + 9 \\cdot 1\\\\\n&= 9 + 16 + 21 + 24 + 25 + 24 + 21 + 16 + 9\\\\\n&= 175\n\\end{align*}\\]\nNow let’s look into the computational part of inner product.\n\nCompute Inner Product from Scratch (without Libraries)\n\nHere’s how you can compute the inner product from the scratch:\n\n# Define matrices A and B\nA = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]\nB = [[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]]\n\n# Function to compute inner product\ndef inner_product(A, B):\n    # Get the number of rows and columns\n    num_rows = len(A)\n    num_cols = len(A[0])\n    \n    # Initialize the result\n    result = 0\n    \n    # Compute the inner product\n    for i in range(num_rows):\n        for j in range(num_cols):\n            result += A[i][j] * B[i][j]\n    \n    return result\n\n# Compute inner product\ninner_product_result = inner_product(A, B)\n\n# Display result\nprint(\"Inner Product (From Scratch):\")\nprint(inner_product_result)\n\nInner Product (From Scratch):\n217\n\n\n\nCompute Inner Product Using NumPy\n\nHere’s how to compute the inner product using Numpy:\n\nimport numpy as np\n# Define matrices A and B\nA = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\nB = np.array([[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]])\n# calculating innerproduct\ninner_product = (A*B).sum() # calculate element-wise product, then column sum\n\nprint(\"Inner Product (Using numpy):\")\nprint(inner_product)\n\nInner Product (Using numpy):\n217\n\n\nThe same operation can be done using SymPy functions as follows.\n\nimport sympy as sp\nimport numpy as np  \n# Define matrices A and B\nA = sp.Matrix([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\nB = sp.Matrix([[7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12]])\n\n# Compute element-wise product\nelementwise_product = A.multiply_elementwise(B)\n\n# Calculate sum of each column\ninner_product_sympy = np.sum(elementwise_product)\n\n# Display result\nprint(\"Inner Product (Using SymPy):\")\nprint(inner_product_sympy)\n\nInner Product (Using SymPy):\n217\n\n\nA vector dot product (in Physics) can be calculated using SymPy .dot() function as shown below.\nLet \\(A=\\begin{pmatrix}1&2&3\\end{pmatrix}\\) and \\(B=\\begin{pmatrix}4&5&6\\end{pmatrix}\\), then the dot product, \\(A\\cdot B\\) is computed as:\n\nimport sympy as sp\nA=sp.Matrix([1,2,3])\nB=sp.Matrix([4,5,6])\ndisplay(A.dot(B)) # calculate fot product of A and B\n\n\\(\\displaystyle 32\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA word of caution\n\n\n\nIn SymPy , sp.Matrix([1,2,3]) create a column vector. But np.array([1,2,3]) creates a row vector. So be careful while applying matrix/ dot product operations on these objects.\n\n\nThe same dot product using numpy object can be done as follows:\n\nimport numpy as np\nA=np.array([1,2,3])\nB=np.array([4,5,6])\ndisplay(A.dot(B.T))# dot() stands for dot product B.T represents the transpose of B\n\nnp.int64(32)\n\n\nPractical Applications\nApplication 1: Signal Processing\nIn signal processing, the inner product can be used to measure the similarity between two signals. Here the most popular measure of similarity is the cosine similarity. This measure is defined as:\n\\[\\cos \\theta=\\dfrac{A\\cdot B}{||A|| ||B||}\\]\nNow consider two digital signals are given.

This is because the matrix can be expressed as a single rank-1 matrix.\nDistributive Property\nThe outer product is distributive over vector addition. For vectors \\(\\mathbf{u}_1, \\mathbf{u}_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^m\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\): \\[(\\mathbf{u}_1 + \\mathbf{u}_2) \\otimes \\mathbf{v} = (\\mathbf{u}_1 \\otimes \\mathbf{v}) + (\\mathbf{u}_2 \\otimes \\mathbf{v})\\]\nAssociativity with Scalar Multiplication\nThe outer product is associative with scalar multiplication. For a scalar \\(\\alpha\\) and vectors \\(\\mathbf{u} \\in \\mathbb{R}^m\\) and \\(\\mathbf{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\): \\[\\alpha (\\mathbf{u} \\otimes \\mathbf{v}) = (\\alpha \\mathbf{u}) \\otimes \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{u} \\otimes (\\alpha \\mathbf{v})\\]\nMatrix Trace\nThe trace of the outer product of two vectors is given by: \\[\\text{tr}(\\mathbf{u} \\otimes \\mathbf{v}) = (\\mathbf{u}^T \\mathbf{v}) \\cdot (\\mathbf{v}^T \\mathbf{u})\\] Here, \\(\\text{tr}\\) denotes the trace of a matrix, which is the sum of its diagonal elements.\nMatrix Norm\nThe Frobenius norm of the outer product matrix can be expressed in terms of the norms of the original vectors: \\[\\| \\mathbf{u} \\otimes \\mathbf{v} \\|_F = \\| \\mathbf{u} \\|_2 \\cdot \\| \\mathbf{v} \\|_2\\] where \\(\\| \\cdot \\|_2\\) denotes the Euclidean norm.\n\n\n\nExample Calculation in Python\nHere’s how to compute and visualize the outer product properties using Python:\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Define vectors\nu = np.array([1, 2, 3])\nv = np.array([4, 5])\n\n# Compute outer product\nouter_product = np.outer(u, v)\n\n# Display results\nprint(\"Outer Product Matrix:\")\nprint(outer_product)\n\n# Compute and display rank\nrank = np.linalg.matrix_rank(outer_product)\nprint(f\"Rank of Outer Product Matrix: {rank}\")\n\n# Compute Frobenius norm\nfrobenius_norm = np.linalg.norm(outer_product, 'fro')\nprint(f\"Frobenius Norm: {frobenius_norm}\")\n\n# Plot the result\nplt.imshow(outer_product, cmap='viridis', interpolation='nearest')\nplt.colorbar()\nplt.title('Outer Product Matrix')\nplt.xlabel('Vector v')\nplt.ylabel('Vector u')\nplt.xticks(ticks=np.arange(len(v)), labels=v)\nplt.yticks(ticks=np.arange(len(u)), labels=u)\nplt.show()\n\nOuter Product Matrix:\n[[ 4  5]\n [ 8 10]\n [12 15]]\nRank of Outer Product Matrix: 1\nFrobenius Norm: 23.958297101421877\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.10: Demonstration of Outer Product and its Properties\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2.4 Kronecker Product\nIn mathematics, the Kronecker product, sometimes denoted by \\(\\otimes\\), is an operation on two matrices of arbitrary size resulting in a block matrix. It is a specialization of the tensor product (which is denoted by the same symbol) from vectors to matrices and gives the matrix of the tensor product linear map with respect to a standard choice of basis. The Kronecker product is to be distinguished from the usual matrix multiplication, which is an entirely different operation. The Kronecker product is also sometimes called matrix direct product.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf \\(A\\) is an \\(m \\times n\\) matrix and \\(B\\) is a \\(p \\times q\\) matrix, then the Kronecker product \\(A\\otimes B\\) is the \\(pm \\times qn\\) block matrix defined as: Each \\(a_{ij}\\) of \\(A\\) is replaced by the matrix \\(a_{ij}B\\). Symbolically this will result in a block matrix defined by:\n\\[A\\otimes B=\\begin{bmatrix}A \\otimes B = \\begin{bmatrix}\na_{11}B & a_{12}B & \\cdots & a_{1n}B \\\\\na_{21}B & a_{22}B & \\cdots & a_{2n}B \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\na_{m1}B & a_{m2}B & \\cdots & a_{mn}B\n\\end{bmatrix} \\end{bmatrix}\\]\n\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n\n\n2.2.2.5 Properties of the Kronecker Product\n\nAssociativity\nThe Kronecker product is associative. For matrices \\(A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}\\), \\(B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p \\times q}\\), and \\(C \\in \\mathbb{R}^{r \\times s}\\): \\[(A \\otimes B) \\otimes C = A \\otimes (B \\otimes C)\\]\nDistributivity Over Addition\nThe Kronecker product distributes over matrix addition. For matrices \\(A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}\\), \\(B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p \\times q}\\), and \\(C \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p \\times q}\\): \\[A \\otimes (B + C) = (A \\otimes B) + (A \\otimes C)\\]\nMixed Product Property\nThe Kronecker product satisfies the mixed product property with the matrix product. For matrices \\(A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}\\), \\(B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p \\times q}\\), \\(C \\in \\mathbb{R}^{r \\times s}\\), and \\(D \\in \\mathbb{R}^{r \\times s}\\): \\[(A \\otimes B) (C \\otimes D) = (A C) \\otimes (B D)\\]\nTranspose\nThe transpose of the Kronecker product is given by: \\[(A \\otimes B)^T = A^T \\otimes B^T\\]\nNorm\nThe Frobenius norm of the Kronecker product can be computed as: \\[\\| A \\otimes B \\|_F = \\| A \\|_F \\cdot \\| B \\|_F\\] where $| |_F $ denotes the Frobenius norm. :::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrobenius Norm\n\n\n\nThe Frobenius norm, also known as the Euclidean norm for matrices, is a measure of a matrix’s magnitude. It is defined as the square root of the sum of the absolute squares of its elements. Mathematically, for a matrix \\(A\\) with elements \\(a_{ij}\\), the Frobenius norm is given by:\n\\[\\|A\\|_F = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i,j} |a_{ij}|^2}\\]\n\n\nExample 1: Calculation of Frobenius Norm\nConsider the matrix \\(A\\):\n\\[A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 \\\\\n3 & 4\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\nTo compute the Frobenius norm:\n\\[\\|A\\|_F = \\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2}\n= \\sqrt{1 + 4 + 9 + 16}\n= \\sqrt{30}\n\\approx 5.48\\]\nExample 2: Frobenius Norm of a Sparse Matrix\nConsider the sparse matrix \\(B\\):\n\\[B = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 5 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\nTo compute the Frobenius norm:\n\\[\\|B\\|_F = \\sqrt{0^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 + 5^2 + 0^2 + 0^2}\n= \\sqrt{25}\n= 5\\]\nExample 3: Frobenius Norm in a Large Matrix\nConsider the matrix \\(C\\) of size $3 $:\n\\[C = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n7 & 8 & 9\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\nTo compute the Frobenius norm:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\|C\\|_F &= \\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2}\\\\\n&= \\sqrt{1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36 + 49 + 64 + 81}\n&= \\sqrt{285}\n&\\approx 16.88\n\\end{align*}\\]\nApplications of the Frobenius Norm\n\nApplication 1: Image Compression: In image processing, the Frobenius norm can measure the difference between the original and compressed images, indicating how well the compression has preserved the original image quality.\nApplication 2: Matrix Factorization: In numerical analysis, Frobenius norm is used to evaluate the error in matrix approximations, such as in Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). A lower Frobenius norm of the error indicates a better approximation.\nApplication 3: Error Measurement in Numerical Solutions: In solving systems of linear equations, the Frobenius norm can be used to measure the error between the true solution and the computed solution, providing insight into the accuracy of numerical methods.\n\nThe linalg sub module of NumPy library can be used to calculate various norms. Basically norm is the generalized form of Euclidean distance.\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Example 1: Simple Matrix\nA = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\nfrobenius_norm_A = np.linalg.norm(A, 'fro')\nprint(f\"Frobenius Norm of A: {frobenius_norm_A:.2f}\")\n\n# Example 2: Sparse Matrix\nB = np.array([[0, 0, 0], [0, 5, 0], [0, 0, 0]])\nfrobenius_norm_B = np.linalg.norm(B, 'fro')\nprint(f\"Frobenius Norm of B: {frobenius_norm_B:.2f}\")\n\n# Example 3: Large Matrix\nC = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])\nfrobenius_norm_C = np.linalg.norm(C, 'fro')\nprint(f\"Frobenius Norm of C: {frobenius_norm_C:.2f}\")\n\nFrobenius Norm of A: 5.48\nFrobenius Norm of B: 5.00\nFrobenius Norm of C: 16.88\n\n\nFrobenius norm of Kronecker product\nLet us consider two matrices,\n\\[A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 & 2 \\\\\n3 & 4\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\nand\n\\[B = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 5 \\\\\n6 & 7\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\nThe Kronecker product \\(C = A \\otimes B\\) is:\n\\[C = \\begin{bmatrix}\n1 \\cdot B & 2 \\cdot B \\\\\n3 \\cdot B & 4 \\cdot B\n\\end{bmatrix}\n= \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 5 \\\\\n6 & 7\n\\end{bmatrix} & \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 \\cdot 2 & 5 \\cdot 2 \\\\\n6 \\cdot 2 & 7 \\cdot 2\n\\end{bmatrix} \\\\\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 \\cdot 3 & 5 \\cdot 3 \\\\\n6 \\cdot 3 & 7 \\cdot 3\n\\end{bmatrix} & \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 \\cdot 4 & 5 \\cdot 4 \\\\\n6 \\cdot 4 & 7 \\cdot 4\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\nThis expands to:\n\\[C = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 5 & 0 & 10 \\\\\n6 & 7 & 12 & 14 \\\\\n0 & 15 & 0 & 20 \\\\\n18 & 21 & 24 & 28\n\\end{bmatrix}\\]\nComputing the Frobenius Norm\nTo compute the Frobenius norm of \\(C\\):\n\\[\\|C\\|_F = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\sum_{j=1}^{4} |c_{ij}|^2}\\]\n\\[\\|C\\|_F = \\sqrt{0^2 + 5^2 + 0^2 + 10^2 + 6^2 + 7^2 + 12^2 + 14^2 + 0^2 + 15^2 + 0^2 + 20^2 + 18^2 + 21^2 + 24^2 + 28^2}\\]\n\\[\\|C\\|_F = \\sqrt{0 + 25 + 0 + 100 + 36 + 49 + 144 + 196 + 0 + 225 + 0 + 400 + 324 + 441 + 576 + 784}\\]\n\\[\\|C\\|_F = \\sqrt{2896}\\] \\[\\|C\\|_F \\approx 53.87\\]",
